the scripts in this folder are for development purposes only. they try to establish a workflow between source code generated by *STM32CubeIDE* and *Arduino IDE*. 

## variants 

update the variant files:

1. `collect_variant_files.sh` collects and copies files from a board’s `firmware` folder to the local `variant` folder. 
2. `link_variant_files.sh‌` symlinks all the files in the local `variant` into the STM32duino variant folder.

all relevant files are listed in a board-specific text file `$KLST_BOARD_NAME-variant-files.txt` located in a board’s `firmware` folder ( e.g `../KLST_PANDA/firmware/KLST_PANDA-variant-files.txt` ).
